# My dotfiles repository

Welcome to my dotfiles repo, feel free to contribute if you like.

## How to use?

After a fresh install of Kubuntu 20.04 ( I use minimal install ), run the following commands to install my dotfiles:

```
sudo apt install git
mkdir git
cd git
git clone https://github.com/data-stepper/dotfiles
```
